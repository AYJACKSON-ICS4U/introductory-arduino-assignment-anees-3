## Arduino project using the bread board just a log

### _Before November 1st_ : 

The couple weeks before November 1st were mainly a discovery phase of the project for us. Jason and I (Anees) spent lots of time trying to understant the way the wires worked on the board and struggled a bit when we got started, to find a button that actually worked whn it was pressed. Eventually we became comfortable with the way the nanoboard works and we started working with the Simpe_PB_LED_V1 file. After editing this file for a while, we decided on a new goal to switch around the way it works and try to get the light to switch off when the button is let go of.

_**November 1st**_ : 

Today we worked on the bread board and got the light press the right way. We tried figuring it out how to switch it from the light flashing when not pressed and not flashing when it is pressed. We were informed that instead of just coding it, we could use the code that was already included for it. We also expanded our knowledge of the breadboard by seeing how the current flows. We took out a connection and made a longer "chain " or connection going with 4 extra _"cables"/wires_. This was very impressive to us. Also with the code we have this glitch that everyone should have where when you press it sometimes a panel bounces and it would stay on instead of turning off when the button is pressed.  

_**November 8th**_ : 

Today was much more of a formatting and getting organized period for us than anything else. We fully updated our GitHub repo, upload 3 pictures **that can be seen below**, and we are much more confident with our project now that we have a log to keep track of our commits. We started discussing how we could edit the Toggle file on Arduino so that the light does not bounce every time we press it quickly. Overall, today was very productive and our goal for next week is to fix the bouncing problem once and for all. After that, we aren't really sure what to do.
