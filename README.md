Arduino project using the bread board just a log

Today November 1st we worked on the bread board and got the light press the right way. We tried figuring it out how to switch it from the light flashing when not pressed and not flashing when it is pressed, but instead we got code that was already downloaded. We also expanded our knowledge of the breadboard by seeing how the current flows. We took out a connection and made a longer "chain " or connection going with 4 extra cables. this was very impressive to us. Also with the code we have this glitch that everyone should have where when you press it sometimes a panel bounces and it would stay on instead of turning aff when the button is pressed.
