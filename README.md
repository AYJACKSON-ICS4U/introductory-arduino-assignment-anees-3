## Arduino project using the bread board just a log

### _ November 1st_ : 

Today we worked on the bread board and got the light press the right way. We tried figuring it out how to switch it from the light flashing when not pressed and not flashing when it is pressed. We were informed that instead of just coding it, we could use the code that was already included for it. We also expanded our knowledge of the breadboard by seeing how the current flows. We took out a connection and made a longer "chain " or connection going with 4 extra _"cables"/wires_. This was very impressive to us. Also with the code we have this glitch that everyone should have where when you press it sometimes a panel bounces and it would stay on instead of turning off when the button is pressed.  

A screenshot of the code we used for the "push and hold for light" is below:

A screenshot of the code we used for the "regular light switch (without bounce fix") is below:
